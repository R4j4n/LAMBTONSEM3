Then her story is just she was soo drunk when her friends said she was perfectly fine. she said anything she could to try to make it seem as if she was unaware of what she was doing.

The most caring and honest guys I&#39;ve ever met were &quot;weirdos&quot; because they do what&#39;s right, not what society tells them.

Hell, my husband almost commit suicide before he met me because he felt he was a failure because of the impression that was put on him. After coming to terms with his feelings and having the support of his friends to be open, he came out of the depressive stage he was in and was able to function normally (i.e., actually eat food and stop starving himself). The same thing is said for women. This isn&#39;t a feminazi plan to get people to be more &quot;girlie&quot;.

It is a very simple premise and does seem to be part of our culture. We as a culture do not really allow men to have feelings or to process them. Instead we, as men, are told to not have feelings, to get over them, to ignore them or to bury them. The only acceptable feeling to have is anger (which is also the easiest).¬†<br><br>In the comments section, there seems to be some debate on how this video is attacking masculinity and it seems to be replicating the idea that idea that having &quot;feelings of fear, embarrassment, sadness, hurt etc&quot; is not ok. It is ok to have them... but it is not ok to be &quot;ruled&quot; by them.

It is their fear and/or embarrassment at not being able to do anything to help that might be driving it... but feeling your feeling and dealing with them... is being a man... and more importantly... it is being an adult man.¬†",148,7,2014-03-30T23:54:56Z,2025-02-11T14:00:41.209193

He and his fellow outcasts share a voracious appreciation for all things &#39;90s hip-hop, opting to sport Cross-Colours and Z. Cavariccis at the risk of being clowned at school. He dreams of attending Harvard, but first he has to make it home every day. When a drug dealer takes a shine to Malcolm and invites him to his birthday party, Malcolm‚Äôs crew is swirled into a hilarious blender of offbeat characters and bad choices where redemption can only be found in Bitcoin.<br><br>Rick Famuyiwa, born on June 18, 1973, is an emerging Hollywood writer and director of films such as The Wood (1999), Talk To Me (2007), and Brown Sugar (2002). He is a first-generation Nigerian American. His most recent film is the comedy Dope (2015) which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Famuyiwa‚Äôs films mainly explore themes of racial diversity and acceptance of oneself and others, especially within communities of color. In the majority of Famuyiwa‚Äôs films, friendship plays a central role to the characters‚Äô development and progression throughout the film. Additionally, thus far, nearly all of Famuyiwa‚Äôs feature films have dealt with the institution of marriage in one form or another. It is helpful to note also that Rick Famuyiwa‚Äôs upbringing in the racially eclectic Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood has had a tremendous impact on his cinematic works and point of view as both an individual and artist.",6,0,2015-03-27T00:32:14Z,2025-02-11T14:00:46.726762

The time of the Fresh prince, when Will Smith was still a punk and of M.C. Hammer.

zzq7dfZn31k,Ugzuo2Mw9yrizXVh_Th4AaABAg,@AWalkingHat,"* Spoiler Alert *<br>I watched this film after a make-up artist told me I reminded her of Cobie Smulders. I had never heard of her and came across this trailer. &quot;Unexpected&quot; is worth watching. It is a realistic take on a woman&#39;s experience with pregnancy. It shows how women are having children later nowadays and value their career very highly. The only issue I have with it is how the film is trying so hard to avoid sentimentalism and stereotypes, it fails to tell some essential elements of its own story. &quot;Unexpected&quot; puts a lot of emphasis on Mrs Abbott&#39;s fear of losing her career and identity by being reduced to someone&#39;s Mom. I thought this would lead up to Abbott acknowledging the importance of her child&#39;s life when the maternal instinct would kick in and her worries about her career would be replaced with love for her daughter. Not so, we barely get to see her with her baby. The film ends abruptly and we don&#39;t even get to see the teenage student having her own baby. There was a lot of potential to expand on Abbott&#39;s tense relationship with her mother and the possible origins of her neuroticism, but we see little of this too. Still worth a watch, though. Smulders delivers a good performance, especially when Abbott is having emotional meltdowns. It is very credible and touching.",10,0,2019-06-03T22:22:01Z,2025-02-11T14:00:50.196526

Being I do believe in a higher power. Given that everything just does not come from nothing. Yet given the fact that every Country around the globe has their own religious beliefs and God. To which there are over 100. Only tells you that people made things up to define their existence in different regions of the world. Then turned it into a hard cover. As time passed by. They learned how to uniform and dress their beliefs into practices and theatrical displays.¬†<br><br>How can man in any way shape or form jot down the teachings of something that created multiple universes and galaxies. People did not even know the Earth revolved around the sun, and thought that the Heavens were in the clouds. Planes debunked that theory. In 1000 or 2000 years there will be another God, and more teaching of this new God. Just like the fading of Greek and Egyptian Gods. Every Millennia a new 1 emerges. With a massive colt to follow it.¬†<br><br>Well I can not knock people needing to believe in something in life after death. Yet I do find it funny that every person who believes in the Holy spirit etc. When someone says they saw a ghost . People deem them as being crazy. Meaning deep down inside people know its hocus pocus drivel. Are there things we can not explain on this planet. Sure. I wont rule that out, because I did not create everything. Is there life on other planets. Sure. I can not rule that out, because I did not create everything. Yet then when you find out insects like roaches came here through meteorites. Then you look at the vast number of creatures and human races on this planet. Gets pretty hard to rule that out. Especially after scientists found out that Mars was once like Earth. Till to which this day there is oxygen in the caves, new found plant life, and water puddles still on Mars.<br><br>I&#39;m not ruling out for a second if we go deeper into or Universe our Galaxy. That we would not find different forms of life. Given we still have not discovered all the creatures in our Ocean floor; which we are still finding new species all the time.<br><br>Yet what I do not like is movies like this. That exploits people. Especially young minds into believing in drivel. Then following crappy practices. That essentially ruins a child&#39;s potential at life. By following cult like practices. While they deem themselves unworthy of their current life, and believes themselves to be sacrifices. No different then Ancient traditions that offered human¬†sacrifices¬†through volcanoes or throwing them off cliffs etc. ¬†",1,11,2015-01-26T22:34:59Z,2025-02-11T14:00:51.343150

It gets better. The Officer in charge arms the journalists who are their to film, with pistols (and no extra magazines, just a pistol) - A weapon that is largely useless against the Heavies, over their very vocal objections. Just what did the OIC think a couple of untrained journalists would do with a weapon they didn‚Äôt want? But wait! There‚Äôs more!

If they take that away, coupled with how terrible Rec 3 was, then ill have no hope for the horror genre ever again. To me this series (well 1 and 2) gave zombie type movies a refresher for me. Then of course 3 happened, and no matter how much we would all love to say it didnt it did. The director should just cut off his hands and end his writing career. Been waiting for a long long time for this, they better deliver. Im hoping this will be that rare jem that the third film in the series is just as good if not better then the original.

Ty59CR6sux4,UgwmbfwP20nxVle3M2p4AaABAg,@luizgomes4125,"[ PALAVRAS PENETRANTES ] O estado de coisas sobre a terra n√£o √© normal, Homens desprovidos de escr√∫pulos e em cujas m√£os se achar o poder, negam teimosamente as verdades ma√≠s importantes, impedindo possa a Humanidade viver no bem estar e evoluir em paz como DEUS o deseja. As ci√™ncias naturais e f√≠sicas acham-se em contradi√ß√£o com a religi√£o, discutindo ainda sobre a exist√™ncia de DEUS e da alma humana. N√£o podemos nem reconhecer, nem admitir seu modo de ver. Ambas acham-se em erro, Igreja e ci√™ncia. A verdade ai est√°. Lede-a com aten√ß√£o. Existe o CRIADOR que, gra√ßas √° Sua Pot√™ncia e Sabedoria, criou leis de cujas efic√°cia Divina nasceu o Universo. A grandeza do Universo n√£o pode ser concebida pelo intelecto do homem. A vida do Universo possui muitas grada√ß√µes. Em mais de um ter√ßo do Universo existe vida Humana manifestada de v√°rias formas. O homem chamado por DEUS √° vida comp√µe-se de ESPIRITO, ALMA E CORPO. O Esp√≠rito da vida a alma. A Alma Humana √© imortal destina-se a evolu√ß√£o. O aperfei√ßoamento das partes materiais do corpo concretizam-se atrav√©s de longos per√≠odos de tempo. A morte do corpo √© o despir-se a Alma do h√°bito da mat√©ria. O nascimento do homem na mat√©ria, √© o retomar de vestido, d√°-se com o fim de cumprir experi√™ncias evolutivas, no plano denso da mat√©ria. Ao reencarnar-se o homem perde a capacidade de recordar-se a fim de que sua mente permane√ßa livre. Com a morte o homem retoma sua capacidade de recordar-se, podendo assim verificar o desenvolvimento de sua evolu√ß√£o, os erros cometidos e como remedi√°-los na pr√≥xima encarna√ß√£o. O Espirito √© mais forte que a mat√©ria. Esta realidade foi elaborada pelo homem terrestre durante sua hist√≥ria e tem toda sua perda . Todo o homem, n√£o importa sobre qual planeta viva, participa solidamente da opera√ß√£o de seus av√≥s . Todo homem √© a reencarna√ß√£o do pr√≥prio av√¥, o operador das √©pocas precedentes. Todo homem encontra-se na situa√ß√£o que ele pr√≥prio cria. Se preparou uma guerra dever√° sofrer-lhe tamb√©m as consequ√™ncias, vivendo em sua reencarna√ß√£o, num caos inimagin√°vel. Todo homem conserva mesmo depois da morte, todo seu saber, o fruto de suas experi√™ncias,seus dotes e o grau de sua evolu√ß√£o. Estas qualidades permanecem com ele e cada vez que voltar ao MUNDO ESPIRITUAL, fica inteiramente consciente delas. Cada vida que se desenvolver sobre Planetas mat√©rias n√£o passar√° de uma viagem, uma breve separa√ß√£o do MUNDO ESPIRITUAL, que √© a verdadeira p√°tria do homem. O MUNDO ESPIRITUAL, √© inimagin√°vel, para cada homem que viver sobre qualquer planeta. √â poderoso e maior do que o UNIVERSO MATERIAL. O homem poder√° encarnar-se sobre todos os planetas habitados. O homem √© governado por uma justi√ßa suprema. Ser√° de todo imposs√≠vel seja danificado em qualquer forma. Aquilo que n√£o recebeu na terra poder√° receber no mundo espiritual , ou mesmo numa futura reencarna√ß√£o. O homem enriquecido n√£o chegou a nenhum grau que o permita conservar a riqueza depois da morte, ou numa futura reencarna√ß√£o, de acordo com seu verdadeiro grau evolutivo,como homem vir√° a nascer em qualquer situa√ß√£o necess√°ria. Quem possuir o poder na terra, ou num planeta, por for√ßa da justi√ßa corrupta vir√° ao mundo como escravo ,para provar as consequ√™ncias do injusto uso do poder. Ningu√©m ter√° o direito de encarnar-se sempre na mesma ra√ßa. Cada homem da terra j√° passou atrav√©s de diversas ra√ßas. Nascer√° ora como homem, ora como mulher. Um crist√£o de hoje, poder√° ter sido hebreu, um europeu, um indiano. Um padre poder√° nascer ateu, n√£o entendendo de mais nenhuma religi√£o. Tudo isto d√°-se segundo a Lei da evolu√ß√£o estabelecida pelo CRIADOR O QUAL √â A CONSCI√äNCIA CENTRAL DO UNIVERSO. Ela √© a Justi√ßa que sempre compensa a mant√©m presente a evolu√ß√£o. O homem dever√° saber que sua condi√ß√£o de Homem colocar-o √° √° prova de muitas formas. Poder√° este caminho durar por mil√™nios, porque o Universo √© incrivelmente grande e cont√©m todos os graus evolutivos. O maior pecado que o homem venha a cometer reside naquele de perseguir ou danificar a um seu semelhante, n√£o importando a que ra√ßa perten√ßa.

He was a model prisoner who pretended to know nothing, and he calmly asked for a lawyer... Patsies don&#39;t kill cops. Where was the outrage?.. Innocent suspects act one way, and guilty suspects act another way. Innocent suspects are often angry, and guilty suspects often keep their cool. Calculating.<br><br>All that said, I am 100% certain that Oswald could not have and did not act alone. That there were co-conspirators. Those who planned the motorcade route, and positioned Oswald at the TSBD. These traitors all but pulled the trigger... Were there other snipers in place? There is some evidence of that, but they were only in place in case Oswald, the designated fall-guy, missed. Oswald didn&#39;t miss, and all three shots came from him.<br><br>All other theories have been debunked, but my theory has not, because that is what actually happened... There are a host of other red flags that strongly point to conspiracy, as well... Like all the attention Oswald got before the assassination. The positioning of Abraham Zapruder, who was there to document the assassination. What value would his film have had, then or since, if no assassination took place, and Kennedy just driving by? The value of such a film would have been minimal. A few seconds of the least interesting part of the motorcade route. Nothing else in the shot to provide context, scale or importance. Or time and place, or what event. The Zapruder film without the assassination would have been pointless. SO, WHAT WAS ZAPRUDER DOING THERE?..<br><br>Then you have the symbolism of the black umbrella man and the Cuban right there at the exact spot where Kennedy was to be taken out. They were there to let Kennedy know why he was about to die, and they could have also been used as signal men... Then you have the assassination of the assassin by another shady character.<br><br>So, how did they all get away with it?.. It was the conspiracy nonsense that poisoned the well, and allowed the establishment to discredit and ridicule all conspiracy theories, including the credible and plausible ones... Ditto 9/11... The conspiracy nonsense that was mixed in with probable theories is what got the neocons off the hook... Conspiracy nonsense is used as a straw man to misrepresent the opposing view.<br><br>Here&#39;s the big smoking gun about 9/11: Amateur Cessna pilots cannot fly commercial jet airliners, let alone with military precision, and getting everything just right on the first attempt, which was the one and only chance that the accused hijackers had.

I grew up in football country, and played all the big 4 sports through high school. ¬†Half way through HS, I started focusing on hockey in Kent, Ohio and quickly realized that hockey was a lot more &quot;fun&quot; than the other sports. ¬†Also, its a sport you can play the rest of your life‚Ä¶there is an Over 70 and over 80 Division in numerous adult tournaments in Canada and the US. ¬†I doubt if there are many active, competitive boxers/MMA still doing it, after the age of 30, even for shits and grins. ¬†<br><br>2) Even pros from other sports think its more &quot;fun&quot;. ¬† I played with the Pittsburgh Celebrity Hockey team for 4 years with numerous Penguin Alumni, but also 6 or 7 Pittsburgh Steelers on the team, including Hall of Fame linebacker Jack Lambert (one mean MFo, you should agree). ¬†These were charity games we played, and more fans wanted to see Lambert, Tunch Ilken, Bill Hurley, and other Steelers play. ¬†Like Boom Boom, all these tough ex-pro football players had a part of them that wished they had played hockey instead of football, ¬†for all of the aforementioned reasons. ¬†<br><br>3) Hockey players are educated and intelligent, for the most part, and are extremely successful after their pro career is over. ¬† Many/most pro hockey players have not just college degrees, but played their pre NHL hockey in this country at D-1 Universities like Harvard, Princeton, Michigan, Notre Dame, RPI, Brown (all the Ivies) ¬†plus Boston College, BU, Providence, etc. UNLIKE ¬†college hoops and football, they GRADUATE from these institutions. ¬†No &quot;one year and done&quot; ¬†into the NBA and NFL like the exploitative SEC and other universities that will accept players who are reading at a 6th grade level.<br><br>I know you want to say, &quot;well, MMA&#39;s will kick any tough hockey players ass, and you didn&#39;t talk about the real shit, man!&quot;<br><br>Well, the real shit is‚Ä¶.what&#39;s really important for you to understand‚Ä¶.is apples and oranges. ¬†Actually, Bad apples and oranges‚Ä¶.¬†<br><br>One sport‚Ä¶your MMA/boxing/cage fighting‚Ä¶..is, while great disciplines/sports, should remain just that. ¬†But the big money exploitative machine that is Pro Boxing and Pro MMA are using uneducated, unsophisticated kids as pawns for all of the wrong humanitarian reasons, putting them out on the streets with a little pocket change, and setting their brains up for a failed future because the object of the sport is to pummel and destroy the opponents&#39; head and body, literally to the death.<br><br>The other sport, hockey‚Ä¶..well, if you don&#39;t get what I said so far, its obvious that your early MMA induced dementia has a stranglehold on you, or you were just born stupid.<br><br>Please don&#39;t fuck with real hockey players‚Ä¶.its not real smart of you, pretty boy.<br><br>¬†<br><br>¬† ¬†",0,0,2014-09-08T06:16:06Z,2025-02-11T14:01:17.456483

Hitch was about helping nerds get the girl of their dreams and a &#39;happily ever after&#39;.<br>3. The Wedding Ringer is about helping guys look cool at their weddings.<br>How does this movie have anything to do with Hitch?<br><br>The character Doug is already getting married. He just needs to pretend he has friends. The only thing that I can say is simpler to Hitch is that we all know at the end that Kevin is gonna end up being friends with the Doug character. Just like Will was with Albret Brennaman.¬†,23,0,2015-01-16T17:53:51Z,2025-02-11T14:01:38.349750

Marilyn was if anything a very shrewd woman and aware of herself and her public relations, persona and or image sure she made bad discussions which are called mistakes and all human beings are subject error.<br>This isn&#39;t a horrible movie but it leaves a lot to be desired.<br>I&#39;m sure that people who knew Marilyn personally and or intimately would attest to the fact that she wasn&#39;t a breathy a little girl lost looking to for any kind of attention and by any means necessary from her so called allies, I mean this should&#39;ve been called the public perception of Marilyn.<br>Marilyn read classic books had aspirations of playing the deep soulful dramatic roles so she was no gullible push over not even the Kennedys look at the men she married she loved respected and admired interlect so she didn&#39;t camp out at the gutter to get a man.<br>So basically if you wanna know the real Norma Jean Marilyn Baker Monroe the library is your friend along with the rare intimate audio interviews, just try them out you won&#39;t be disappointed.",10,2,2017-07-04T01:26:44Z,2025-02-11T14:01:38.762880

Also Marilyn was 2 people, she was the &quot;actress..star&quot; Marilyn but she also was the &quot;person&quot; Marilyn.  Catherine made the character the &quot;actress/star&quot; Marilyn and didn&#39;t show her personal side.  Watching with a couple of interviews showed her as a fairly normal person (as much as can be possible,  a stunningly beautiful and just as stunning speaking).  It only showed her weakness&#39; in her relationships which is well known that her partner also had problems brought into the relationship,  They made it seem that they had to put up with Marilyn&#39;s problems and flaws while not really showing their flaws much.  Joe DiMaggio had his jealousy and disapproval of the &quot;actress doing her job&quot; Marilyn and his somewhat jealous nature. Which at least was more realistic.   It didn&#39;t show Arthur Miller&#39;s flaws enough.  There was dynamic involving 2 people not just Marilyn&#39;s problems and weakness&#39;.

The Joe in this barely spoke but apparently the real Joe was like that. Here they make him look like he was jealous of his wife&#39;s star power but real life friends say he actually wanted to protect her from the industry which made her famous but also ruined her, he banned holly weird from the funeral, he was there for her after the divorce and rumoured they were going to get back together.

It was obvious Robbie liked Ricky when Francisca pointed it the first time at the pool but I knew he loved or felt something for after he talked to her about &quot;the kiss&quot;. Love is something that people can find only a few times or several times but to know that someone will love  the real you and accept you regardless.

But then again since his works are so purely cinematic and abstract, it&#39;s instinctual, if you instinctively don&#39;t really have much of a reaction to Malick&#39;s work, or even just see it as pretentious &quot;oohh look at the clouds and water and trees and rocks, oohh look someone is brushing their hands against wheat, oohhh look more dancing &quot; bs, I can completely understand.

Go watch the Transformers series again&quot;, I&#39;ve seen comments like this more than you can count. Unlike other directors whose works are more rigidly constructed, Malick feels free form and abstract, open to interpretation, and this results in a much more personal and individual experience. And with Malick that&#39;s exactly what it is, it&#39;s a personal preference, you like what you like, and you don&#39;t like what you don&#39;t like, and shaming someone because they don&#39;t share your preference just creates less difference in opinion, a more one sided conversation, and this results in less insight into film in general.",36,5,2014-12-16T01:39:06Z,2025-02-11T14:01:45.826558

You can hate his movies for being boring because you completely have that right. It&#39;s art. It will always be subjective.

Like his good friend McCarthy you&#39;ll often find Malick relying on the audiences intellect and ability to project personal philosophy, emotions and experience into his films. A lot of movies want you to watch them dance, and, I&#39;ve always had the feeling Terrence insists you get off the wall and dance with him. Tree of Life was an astounding feat of human¬†consciousness and evolution. Based roughly on his own life experiences you really get a sense of how he views the world and the meaning behind the curtain. In addition, I think most people are right, Terrence is pretentious, highly artistic and often frustrating in his lack of description. People fumble with his projects, they get confused, bored and lose interest easily. Not everyone is on the same page in life, let alone intellect or creativity and to assume we should all walk hand in hand into every film, book or piece of entertainment with a single consensus is asinine.<br><br>I love deep, pretentious literature (Oh God, I&#39;ve read everything Umberto Eco has done, The Name of The Rose had a fucking index in it that&#39;s required throughout for reference, come&#39;on) but it&#39;s because I&#39;ve spent years getting to a place where my academic understanding of biology, cosmology, philosophy and human history is mature enough to walk alongside and compliment these types of projects.¬†",5,0,2015-01-07T07:59:13Z,2025-02-11T14:01:45.826558

I also liked Lewis‚Äôs direction, the cinematography and the use of stock music. Although I don‚Äôt remember watching it when I was a kid, it was the kind of movie I did used to watch growing up in the suburbs of Detroit on horror host Sir Graves Ghastly‚Äôs movie show, and on Chiller Theater on Long Island.

Misogyny is defined as a hatred or dislike of women. There is no misogyny in that clip. In reality, it&#39;s the opposite. It&#39;s a strong like for women. 

Don&#39;t confuse &quot;sleazy&quot; or &quot;deception&quot; with &quot;misogyny&quot;.

She goes fearlessly into the industry, the farms and gets high quality and publishable photos for the cause. The relief for her is the animals at the sanctuaries and taking photos of them.<br><br>There are so many shots, so many different kinds of animals suffering in the movie. I got a bit short of breath while watching, got all sorts of terrible memories revisited and cried out. This shouldn&#39;t be happening and this shouldn&#39;t be hidden. It is wild how we hate ourselves as a society so much that we let this happen and continue.<br><br>People get focused over what is cringe and what is lame so much, they go to musicians and cool artists and leave hate comments, death threats all the time if they challenge the industry. But that kind of thing isn&#39;t even related to the animal abuse industry. Why do people have so much time to hate on things that are not even hateable? If they focus on such minute things and not the important ones like this then we truly live in a hopeless hell.<br><br>I find that other reviews on here are trying to find excuses to hate on this movie, methods are not okay? Emotional manipulation? It‚Äôs like we are not on real emotional manipulation 24/7. This is actual emotion, this is real, this is about actual lives that suffer, it is not CGI, it‚Äôs not special effects. It is made for the purpose to save lives that are even now currently being killed and abused in the most creative ways mankind could ever. I wish people would actually focus on the environment, themselves and the healt, but they don‚Äôt even do that. What the hell are our priorities? Why are we not concerned about this? Why do we fear the truth so much that others have to die for it? If we all had more bravery we wouldn‚Äôt need to live in a dystopia, we could actually focus on making the world a better place and we could make and consume entertainment without any guilt. Why is our environment dominated by guilt?<br><br>I want everyone to watch movies like this, read books like this and share them. It is not a matter of personal taste or what you like. This is lives at stake and until they are saved, the quality of this movie, even though I think it is a legit good movie, doesn‚Äôt even matter. The message is so powerful that the movie should be promoted regardless of aesthetics.<br><br>I don‚Äôt want to live in a world where sad animal eyes haunt us at every corner.",2,0,2024-05-10T19:55:18Z,2025-02-11T14:01:59.850164

ngLwnXEJCpA,UggbMeYFEcezuHgCoAEC,@ianwestc,"Ended up watching this on Netflix streaming. It&#39;s not bad, especially for a not-so-high-budget direct to video production. Acting was ok, script was exceptionally predictable, bland, and by-the-numbers. The effects are... hit-and-miss. There&#39;s more important detail on the dragon, and he&#39;s well-rendered and semi-well-acted, however there wasn&#39;t much articulation on the model. Facial expressions were fairly static, and not many facial muscles moved when he spoke. Compare to Dragonheart, where much work was done to transfer Sean Connery&#39;s expression to Draco. The dragon and team from Dragonheart 3 could not have pulled off the Draco singing to Kara scene. Now, Dragonheart 1 had an estimated budget of $83m in today&#39;s dollars. The budget for Drago in Dragonheart 3 was $7m, but really, the artistry in Dragonheart 1 outshines anything here.<br><br>Battle scenes... due to the low budget, they&#39;re not terribly exciting, certainly nothing like Game of Throne&#39;s Blackwater, to use a recent example. The original Dragonheart also skimped on the details apart from the dragon, and its combat scenes were compared unfavorably to Braveheart&#39;s and Gladiator&#39;s.<br><br>Ben Kingsley has a good voice and is a good actor, but somehow he and the character didn&#39;t really connect. He doesn&#39;t have a lot to do here. It&#39;s not a criticism of him, but there&#39;s no comparison to Connery in the first Dragonheart.<br><br>I&#39;d give it a 6/10, and that&#39;s being a bit generous. The first Dragonheart was a 7 or 7.5 -- honestly it hasn&#39;t aged well compared to the fantasy epics we&#39;ve had since then. The acting and scriptwriting in the first Dragonheart were kindof bad. Better than the sequels, but it still had cardboard-cutout characters.",26,3,2015-03-23T22:38:12Z,2025-02-11T14:02:00.264626

Also their first time talking together and the self-harm scene introduced some comedy into what is otherwise a pretty dry film, I just wish there could have been more of them to make me believe the two develop a friendship.<br>The sorcerer villain started off as quite convincing and made me actually want to see him get beaten up at the end, though as the film when on he became more of an interruption invading the subplots. Perhaps next time they can tone the bad guy down a little and let the dragon/human relationship actually develop independently and become something worth seeing.<br><br>The CGI is forgivable considering it&#39;s a direct-to-dvd sequel with a less than stellar budget. What is not forgivable however is the schizophrenic dragon being the guardian of another dragon&#39;s eggs and killing bad guys to defend them yet literally not giving a s**t when one of the good guys drops one, does he not care what the parents will think or do to him if/when they find out he failed in his responsibilities or are the dragon parents just that uncaring for their own young? Also, is he ever going to take the eggs back to their parents? That should be a major issue for him, making him angry, upset, or emotional in some other sort of way.<br>The corrupt knight was another sore point, he had little development and that which he did have isn&#39;t always consistent. He starts off as a medieval gangster who has other people do the work for him, but then in the end he plays tough making everyone else leave the room so he can fight by himself. If the good guy was looking for a convincing hard fight then he should have gone after the sorcerer.<br><br>6/10 despite it&#39;s faults because dragons.",5,1,2015-04-17T19:31:11Z,2025-02-11T14:02:00.264626

ngLwnXEJCpA,Ugjwjg7cvggYBngCoAEC,@Walt_Xander94,"I saw the film on Netflix, just as good as the first movie, and way better than the second one. I didn&#39;t even know there was a Dragonheart 3, and I thought the film was going to suck because its a straight-to-DVD movie, but I was wrong. I read that there might be a Dragonheart 4 because the 3rd one was good.<br><br>I&#39;m curious if its going to be another prequel, or sequel. Now sure, the end of the film pretty much showed that another film is coming, they&#39;ll probably make a series of films all set after 3, but after seeing this, it makes me think. In the first 2 films, they made it a big deal about the dragon being the last of their kind, but for one, in 2, the villain was a dragon the whole time, Griffin, but his heart was cut out, and that dragon&#39;s backstory was that he betrayed the dragons, killed humans, so a Chinese emperor ordered the killing of all dragons, so all dragons in China must&#39;ve been wiped out, not dragons all of over the world. In fact, in what part of Earth does the Dragonheart films take place? They say nearly all dragons were wiped out, but for all they know, dragons were probably hiding in many different places around the world, and only quite a few were killed in certain places, and people just assumed they were all dead. So Dragonheart films could take place in different parts of the world if done right.<br><br>Secondly, if dragons come from space, then the dragons aren&#39;t completely gone, so if they wanted to, they could set a Dragonheart film after 2, where another meteor hits, another dragon shows up, with eggs, but the dragon is evil and maybe that dragon shares his heart with someone, then there would be an enemy dragon and....dragonborn I guess(I dont remember them ever giving a human whose heart is shared with a dragon&#39;s, a cool name), and the film wouldn&#39;t have to take place in the same medieval setting, how about one set in China with Samurai, or one set in Ancient Rome with Gladiators.",1,1,2015-03-08T02:31:22Z,2025-02-11T14:02:00.264626

I don&#39;t understand why he gets so much hate from everyone, he&#39;s like the Pauly Shore of the 2000&#39;s, lol. I don&#39;t think Jamie Kennedy is the worst comedian ever like the majority of the people here do, he&#39;s okay. He&#39;s not the greatest or the worst, but he doesn&#39;t deserve all the hate he gets. He was in a couple decent movies, and whether people admit it or not anyone who was in high school when &quot;Malibu&#39;s Most Wanted&quot; came out loves that movie, lol. People nowadays act like Malibu&#39;s most wanted is the worst movie ever made and will just destroy the movie when they talk about it, but when it was in theaters and when it first came out on DVD it was a big hit. Everyone back then knew most of the scenes and quotes from that movie, and it was on cable Television all the fucking time. I think where Jamie Kennedy really fucked his career up was when he decided to do &quot;Son of the Mask.&quot; It would have been a difficult task for even the biggest comedy stars to make a decent follow up to Jim Carrey&#39;s classic performance in the Mask, and Jamie Kennedy really couldn&#39;t pull it off. Will Ferrell or Steve Carrel would have had a hard time making that movie work, and as soon as it was announced that Jamie Kennedy was starring in a straight to DVD sequel of the Mask over a decade after the original, it was just doomed and destined to be a huge flop. I tried to watch it once when it first came out and I had to turn it off after 15 minutes because it was just so terrible. So imo Jamie Kennedy isn&#39;t the best comedian ever, but I don&#39;t think he deserves all the hate that he does get, he&#39;s been basically black listed from Hollywood and because of his reputation as the worst, nobody will cast him in any movie, so he&#39;s pretty much destined to travel around the country doing awful stand up in shitty little dive bars around the country.",1,2,2018-09-22T03:21:09Z,2025-02-11T14:02:09.172379

It also reminds me that in the west part of the culture has a warrior streak. David would feel quite manly in warmer cultures, where it&#39;s mainstream to be an emotional man. I&#39;m from Lebanon, and I wouldn&#39;t deny the paternalism that&#39;s holding back the middle east, but I&#39;ve lived in North America (US then Canada) for 20 years, and I noticed some &quot;testosterony&quot; ideas within that culture. Luckily I found my share of nice nerdy friends, including guys, but you see being nerdy is the standard in places like Lebanon, or India, or Korea, or Brazil. As a guy you wouldn&#39;t have to measure up to jogs in the class, because idealizing jogs is more of a thing in warrior cultures: roman, then european, then north american... Some cultures have always promoted humility instead. Imagine a Zen teacher telling you to growl and lift weights! They recommend the exact opposite, letting go of ego. Traditionally middle eastern men could cry and recite poetry in public, belly dance (yes, historically it wasn&#39;t exclusive to woman) and loose themselves in parenting. I love that side of the middle east, which is not the same as denying its flaws by the way. <br><br>Zaha Hadid, a Beirut-trained, Iraki architect, who first practiced in Baghdad then New York, was the first woman to win the Pritzker architecture prize for her remarkable creative building designs. Yet she said she felt more accepted as an architect in the middle east than the US, because middle eastern men don&#39;t hate women. They treat them differently, but don&#39;t hate them. In the west however there is a blind biast for men and a male bond within technical professions that obviates women. The rate of women in tech fields, in engineering for example is lower than in the middle east or Asia, and that bond among &quot;male warriors&quot; might be creating a territorial culture in tech fields, and driving western women away from them. In the US there are 2M women living in shelters from domestic abuse, and that&#39;s just the fraction that made a break for it. Promoting male warrior culture has repercussions in the home (see the dad patronizing the mom in that documentary), and I personally feel safer debating any point with a man from a warm culture, or a humble western nerd than with a western warrior-type.  <br><br>None of that discounts the value of friendship or solidarity among men, or sports, but points to how inflating male egos is dangerous, be to a child, a wife, a sister, a colleague. Also keep in mind, that if you answer by attacking me, you&#39;ll be proving my point about aggressive male warriors.

The teacher is my mentor and those students are my friends. The idea is not to make this movie the best movie out there, but to tell an inspirational story. To challenge the stereotypes and to show what it is like in my community. When they entered the competition everybody thought they had cheated because they were Mexican. This movie was originally called La Vida Robot. You should look it up and read the article. I can see why a lot of people are disappointed because George Lopez is playing a serious role and he helped produced it. This was never going to be made into a film without his support. He is a very nice guy and he just wants to show people why he was moved himself by this story. ¬†",63,4,2014-07-02T21:05:15Z,2025-02-11T14:02:59.351878

Boredom is a behavior. It can not be measured, nor can it be proven to be a theory in the same way that Evolution or Gravity has been. It can only be observed through certain behavior patterns. Animals display behavior patterns that we associate with boredom; This includes humans.

If you appreciate a good horror film. this is solid watch it&#39;s not a horror classic but has a solid script a great main actor who just steals the show.,3,0,2018-01-14T09:08:45Z,2025-02-11T14:03:14.502766

Some of the writing could have been slightly better, but overall an excellent genre telling about monsters that live in a metropolis underground. What I loved about it was despite the lack of physical evidence of the monsters, the movie gives you the colors and let&#39;s you paint the monsters world yourself; giving you bits of information throughout the movie with enough monster action to plug it all together. Not to mention, if you&#39;re a horror fan and have an appreciation for a director who took a risk to fictionalize himself into an act of his very own storytelling.  This found footage style is loosing steam, no doubt. But this introduced something new into the mix. Not something to draw on and be stolen by other writers/filmmakers but something to be celebrated. <br><br>But hey that&#39;s just me.  ",69,2,2015-02-21T01:13:39Z,2025-02-11T14:03:14.873332

Ray Wise was absolutely AWESOME in this. He carried his character perfectly IMHO. It&#39;ll be great for his fans all around. He&#39;s usually the plus in most of the flicks he&#39;s in. Right? It also has great cameos from some well known directors, and, Mr. Jason Voorhees himself, Kane Hodder as well.<br><br>Now the people that WON&#39;T like this are the people who hate found footage/documentary-style movies. They&#39;ll trash it before they&#39;ve even given it a chance just because it&#39;s that type of film. They always do. Also, if you&#39;re expecting a monster-a-minute fast paced gory action film, this ain&#39;t it. I didn&#39;t even really find it scary. A couple of parts might startle you a bit before the end but that&#39;s about it. I don&#39;t think that was the point of it. It&#39;s really supposed to be a movie about the wonder of finding a hidden world right beneath our feet, and, what happens if you get too curious about things you shouldn&#39;t. The mythology of the story worked for me on that level and kept me interested. But then, I don&#39;t have a short attention span when it comes to films.

MCSYNT7Xrfs,UgjMil5KO8vmTXgCoAEC,@Galejro,"Just saw the movie, time for a constructive review: Long story put short, unless you&#39;re an FPS/Found Footage fan this is not a movie for you. It has its good, mid and bad parts. It depends on what you find attractive in this genre that will determine if its a decent movie or not, but if you generally think this genre suck justs don&#39;t waste your time... and reading any further.<br><br>Now to those who are fans and have some experience I&#39;d say it&#39;s mediocre. The amount of positive qualities kinda matches its horrible flaws. <b>Good stuff</b>, it&#39;s an original idea, kinda childish but at the same time alluring mythology. It goes against some cliches of the genre, it&#39;s not 1,5 hours of shooting a forest with the worst possible technique. It doesn&#39;t end the way you would expect. <b>Mid stuff</b>, product placement, the journalist point of view - It makes it feel more professional and adult/epistolatory when we have people moving around the country giving interviews after the events took place, but at the same time it&#39;s a waste of a third of the movie on non-horror stuff in a horror movie that all from the start you just don&#39;t associate yourself with. It&#39;s an attempt to makes us care that fails and brings little to the story. There&#39;s little monsters, like 1 minute of the whole movie, on one hand it lets our imagination do the job and build tension (which is something that works only the 1st time in this genre), on the other its just a pathetic excuse for a low budget FPS flick in the woods, which it basically is, lets face it, it is, only dressed much better. Acting is nice, but we&#39;re not talking major motion picture acting level, actors play well, but we&#39;ll probably just see them in this movie alone. <b>Bad stuff</b>, you can skip to the last third of this movie without a single regret. I like the idea of following a possible hoax and a cook and find it real BUT NOT FOR A FRIGGIN HOUR BEFORE SH..T HITS THE FAN! Worse still, shit hits the fan for like 5 minutes and than its back to the journalism. It&#39;s not like Troll Hunter where sh..t hits the fan in the first 20 minutes of the movie and goes on, deeper and better. It&#39;s unrewarding for a horror movie. It doesn&#39;t deserve the label of horror nor thriller, it literally has 3 momentary scenes that mark it for horror.<br><br>Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s as good as it sucks, but I don&#39;t wanna watch it again. I&#39;d rather re-watch The Bay or The Tunnel than watch this again.",12,0,2015-02-21T22:03:16Z,2025-02-11T14:03:14.873332

He said for the hour they were murdering innocent people they transcended their high school and became known and that&#39;s what he wanted. To be known. So at 15 and 16 years old, he wanted to murder people so he could be famous. And he chose Cassie because she wasn&#39;t romantically interested in him. Zero empathy and sociopathy is not something you grow out of. They say 16 year olds brains are still developing. Guess what? So are 18 year olds.

sEVT8nfjIvA,UgwDBW9MvTige6vrpM94AaABAg,@cm1368,"1 Thessalonians 5:9-10  For God has not appointed us unto wrath... Question: &quot;What is the difference between the Rapture and the Second Coming?&quot;<br><br>Answer:¬†The rapture and the second coming of Christ are often confused. Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether a scripture verse is referring to the rapture or the second coming. However, in studying end-times Bible prophecy, it is very important to differentiate between the two.<br><br>The rapture is when Jesus Christ returns to remove the church (all believers in Christ) from the earth. The rapture is described in¬†1 Thessalonians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=253"">4:13</a>-18¬†and¬†1 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=950"">15:50</a>-54. Believers who have died will have their bodies resurrected and, along with believers who are still living, will meet the Lord in the air. This will all occur in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. The second coming is when Jesus returns to defeat the Antichrist, destroy evil, and establish His millennial kingdom. The second coming is described in¬†Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=1151"">19:11</a>-16.<br><br>The important differences between the rapture and second coming are as follows:<br><br>1) At the rapture, believers meet the Lord in the air (1 Thessalonians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=257"">4:17</a>). At the second coming, believers return with the Lord to the earth (Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=1154"">19:14</a>).<br><br>2) The second coming occurs after the great and terrible tribulation (Revelation chapters 6‚Äì19). The rapture occurs before the tribulation (1 Thessalonians 5:9;¬†Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=190"">3:10</a>).<br><br>3) The rapture is the removal of believers from the earth as an act of deliverance (1 Thessalonians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=253"">4:13</a>-17,¬†5:9). The second coming includes the removal of unbelievers as an act of judgment (Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=1480"">24:40</a>-41).<br><br>4) The rapture will be secret and instant (1 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=950"">15:50</a>-54). The second coming will be visible to all (Revelation 1:7;¬†Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=1469"">24:29</a>-30).<br><br>5) The second coming of Christ will not occur until after certain other end-times events take place (2 Thessalonians 2:4;¬†Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=1455"">24:15</a>-30; Revelation chapters 6‚Äì18). The rapture is imminent; it could take place at any moment (Titus <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=133"">2:13</a>;¬†1 Thessalonians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=253"">4:13</a>-18;¬†1 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=950"">15:50</a>-54).<br><br>Why is it important to keep the rapture and the second coming distinct?<br><br>1) If the rapture and the second coming are the same event, believers will have to go through the tribulation (1 Thessalonians 5:9;¬†Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=190"">3:10</a>).<br><br>2) If the rapture and the second coming are the same event, the return of Christ is not imminent‚Äîthere are many things which must occur before He can return (Matthew 24:4-30).<br><br>3) In describing the tribulation period, Revelation chapters 6‚Äì19 nowhere mentions the church. During the tribulation‚Äîalso called ‚Äúthe time of trouble for Jacob‚Äù (Jeremiah 30:7)‚ÄîGod will again turn His primary attention to Israel (Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVT8nfjIvA&amp;t=677"">11:17</a>-31).<br><br>The rapture and second coming are similar but separate events. Both involve Jesus returning. Both are end-times events. However, it is crucially important to recognize the differences. In summary, the rapture is the return of Christ in the clouds to remove all believers from the earth before the time of God‚Äôs wrath. The second coming is the return of Christ to the earth to bring the tribulation to an end and to defeat the Antichrist and his evil world empire.",19,9,2018-07-08T15:49:44Z,2025-02-11T14:03:24.582603

It turned into a cult classic just like Rocky Horror Picture Show and it was fantastic.  These new movies on SciFi are like the old ones such as Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and It Came from Beneath the Sea.  I applaud SciFi for having someone on staff with a sense of humor like my own - sick.   ,0,0,2013-06-14T02:53:21Z,2025-02-11T14:03:25.970054

Then, I guess, they&#39;re making a series (I assume OAVs) to coincide with the rest of the manga.

Why does every gay themed movie have to be about some kind of struggle and harsh process? American gay themed movies tend to delve into the struggles like: the matthew shepard story, were the world mine, brokeback, private romeo. Yet they also produce comedies, suspense, dramatic, silly ones (monster pies, 24 hours, eCupid, shelter, edge of 17, is it just me, trick) to not encase the gay film world in dramatic underworld-esque themes.

He rolls like a log. Bear goes up to my next friend and he starts freaking out. Well that wasn&#39;t a good idea. Bear bites his head and then my other friend fires the shotgun in the air. Bear runs off. Friends skin is hanging from his head. They wrap a towel around it and hike back home. Within 20 minutes the white towel was red.

ey9fi6m95vo,UgiqIiig6Y8u9HgCoAEC,@horsepower523,The interesting little twist in this movie is that the reason why the bear came near their tent in the first place was because of the guy&#39;s injured/bloody toe and him leaving his bloody socks out to dry. The scent of the blood was what probably attracted that bear. The guy should&#39;ve either buried his socks in the ground or burn them immediately.

They should have stood up outside the tent and claimed their territory by yelling and looking like they could win a fight against him, they also could have sprayed the bear from about 10m with the full range of the bear spray and would deter him from chasing them in the future, they only eat what cant harm them there are easier meals to get",2,1,2017-12-20T06:32:29Z,2025-02-11T14:03:41.746519

vw5vcUPyL90,UgiOFIkZe8Dv9ngCoAEC,@darkraven220,"My take, please add your views.<br><br>Rita somehow managed to either kill Zordon in his reality, or separate Zordon from the interdimensional time warp which connected him to Earth. Without his presence, the Power Rangers lost the actual powers or energies that protected them. Which is why they are using guns with bullets instead of blasters and energy attacks. Also which is why they are not in the Zord but instead are fighting outside of it while it is fighting on it&#39;s own. Without the power or energy, they cannot operate the Zord. Notice how when they used the Zords the very first time it was second nature to them. It was because the power allowed them to connect to their Zord. Without the power they had no connection. Thus the Zord is fighting on it&#39;s own and gets destroyed. The monster that destroyed it is Goldar (my opinion). Also, notice how they aren&#39;t using any superhuman abilities such as jumping high, strength, durability, etc. This is because the power is what gave them the superhuman abilities. Without the power they have the suit, the suit&#39;s inherent tech, and their own human fighting ability. That also explains why Kimberly gets killed on the battle field. It was more than likely an energy attack which their suits cannot protect them against without the power. And also explains why they all were extremely winded while running and fighting. We hear one of them out of breath and wheezing. Because they are normal humans without their abilities. Green Ranger&#39;s suit had the Golden Shield armor which I take as being inherent to the suit and more tech than energy.¬†<br><br>Without the power from Zordon, Rita is able to influence and manipulate the Rangers which she does to Jason, and Billy. Influencing Bulk and Skull was something she could have done anytime since they were never Rangers. It is unknown how Trina died but I assume it was during the battle in the first part of the film. Zach we see using his suit and fighting alongside the bad guys just like Rocky. Remember a rule of the power associated with being a Ranger was that you could not use the power for personal gain and not to initiate a fight. Zach was doing both. Which means the power was no longer with him due to Zordon&#39;s MIA status. And again, we see Zach not using superhuman strength, speed, agility, etc. In fact, the last guy, a human, actually goes toe to toe with him. Because at this point, Zach is simply a highly skilled assassin with body armor. The fact that his suit has no energy is also evident in how damaged it is. All their battles, the suits always regenerate. But his has obvious damage that never cleared. The helmet does deflect bullets, but this is inherent to the metal of the helmet. Side note, Zach says &quot;It&#39;s Morphin time&quot; as a way to show the despair of the current situation. Probably thinking back to when things were different. Or perhaps as an act of defiance to show that his heart is still on the good side.<br><br>So Tommy stays hidden. I think it is because he already knew all along that Kimberley was really Rita in disguise. Notice how Tommy held Kimberly&#39;s body in the battle that I assume is from the first scene, yet Kimberly is present at Trina&#39;s funeral, even tho Trina was in that same battle. How could Kimberly die in that same battle that Trina was in, yet at a later time be at Trina&#39;s funeral? I think nobody else knew that Kimberly died in that battle and Rita quickly took over her body...perhaps they were all distracted with Trina&#39;s death since none of them were even there when Tommy held Kimberly&#39;s dead body. So as Kimberly, Rita is able to get close enough to mind control them. You could see Billy kind of struggling against the mind control. Zach was aware of the situation and probably in despair which is why he didn&#39;t resist letting her kill him. He also figured they were using him to wipe out the remaining resistance and once he was done they would dispose of him anyway. Notice how he wasn&#39;t surprised that it was Kimberly, not that he looked at her, but he saw it coming. And notice how she didn&#39;t bother mind controlling him. Again, because he either knew or was in despair. Unless maybe he thought it was Kimberly killing him for joining the machines. Could be taken different ways I guess. But lets stick with it that he realized it was Rita at some point. Perhaps all along since he was banging Divatox and Scorpina. So Rita kills him to keep her secret secure and because the resistance is now wiped out completely<br><br>Rita needed the image to be kept up so she went along with the interrogation.even crying at the mention of Jason and retorting that she prefers pink at one point, lol! But one thing about it, I think Rocky already knew what was up. Notice how he looks away from Tommy right before they fight. And notice how Tommy doesn&#39;t really make any legit attack on Rocky. Perhaps Rocky looking away was letting Tommy in on something. I think Rocky also kept the appearances of the interrogation up knowing full well that it was really Rita, just to allow Tommy time to break in. Because why else would he, on the bad guy&#39;s side, not know that Kimberly was killed when he knew all the others had been killed? And why would Tommy walk right in to a trap if he already knew Kimberly was dead? Rita took Kimberly&#39;s body knowing Tommy would come after her. She allowed herself to get caught by Rocky in hopes of drawing Tommy out as that was her only way of finding him. Rocky went along with it as a last ditch effort to mount an attack against Rita. Perhaps he and Tommy came up with a plan to attack her once Tommy broke in. Rita kills Rocky before they can assert their plan which leaves Rita and Tommy.¬†",74,17,2015-02-26T03:46:25Z,2025-02-11T14:03:46.146215

What a horrible tragedy, how hard these scenes are and the worst part is that things like this happen in the reality. No family should be like this, the ideal is that families love themselves, but when your family becomes your worst enemy you feel that you have no strength to go out and face the world, and the majority of the common people almost never understand the hurts and the traumas that these families left and they don&#39;t even imagine that these things happen in the reality. There are many people that grew up in toxic, abussive, violent and unstable families. The result of that, is extremely hard and cruel for the victims.

_RbMv7HUiO4,Ugxd-UMmvUaJgH0egDx4AaABAg,@Publiclighthouse,"I remember coming home from college and seeing a friend who I hadn&#39;t connected with in a while.  We had made solid plans to go to a museum later in the week.  When I called him the day of to get his address, I got his voice mail.  When I called him again later on, again voice mail. This happened one more time before the time I was supposed to pick him up, but again, nothing.   Some months later I was talking about this weird behavior with some mutual high school friends we had and I said, &quot;The weirdest thing is,  we made plans but he just didn&#39;t call back or follow through.&quot;  The response I received was, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just what John does.  He makes plans but you can never count on him to actually be somewhere or do it.&quot;  They said this like it was normal.  No one had any feelings of animosity or shades of resentment.  &quot;John not showing up  but saying he would&quot; is supposed to be something we should all expect if we want to be friends with him.  I didn&#39;t understand that.  Time and energy go into planning.  Sure, it may not sound like much - You just need someone&#39;s address to pick them up, but there is some mental and emotional juggling involved.  The anticipation of hanging out with someone you haven&#39;t seen in a while,  or doing something with a friend at the end of your work week is sort of like the carrot at the end of a stick.  Then you get nothing and you are supposed to be okay with being let down?

Mostly due to turning vegan, so I would eat a lot more fresh fruits and vegetables, and a lot of sugar was cut out consequensically. This year - I think due to pressure, plus different moral thoughts, and what not I stopped. I still ate a lot more veggies and fruits that I orginally had and rarely ever meat, but I started eating lots of food with sugar, thinking the only consequence was that it might make me fat (side note it didn&#39;t - but that just shows how decieving it can be). But it actually makes you feel so fatigued - half way down the year and my diet has only increased in sugar in take. For the last couple of weeks/months, I&#39;ve had increased panic attacks and axiety out of no where - no cause, just sudden attacks. Not to mention my moods were all over the place. I would be feeling fine one day - or even hour, and then I would just sink, and for a couple hours, or even days I would feel increasingly depressed.

Der Film, der 1996 ver√∂ffentlicht wurde, ist der zweite Realfilm in der Werner-Reihe und bleibt dem chaotischen und humorvollen Stil der Comics treu.<br><br>Die Handlung folgt erneut dem liebenswerten Chaoten Werner, gespielt von R√∂tger Feldmann selbst, der diesmal auf eine Gruppenreise nach Korsika geschickt wird. Nat√ºrlich ger√§t die Reise schnell au√üer Kontrolle, und Werner findet sich in einer Reihe von komischen und absurden Situationen wieder. Dabei wird er von seinen markanten Freunden wie Meister R√∂hrich und Holgi in gewohnter Manier begleitet.<br><br>Die St√§rke des Films liegt eindeutig im skurrilen Humor und der √ºberzogenen Darstellung der Charaktere. Feldmann bringt die liebgewonnenen Figuren der Comics auf die Leinwand und sorgt daf√ºr, dass Fans der Vorlagen ihre Helden in gewohnter Form erleben k√∂nnen. Die Dialoge sind durchsetzt mit derben Spr√ºchen und skurrilen Einf√§llen, die den unverwechselbaren Charme der Werner-Welt ausmachen.<br><br>Die Mischung aus Real- und Zeichentricksequenzen bleibt ein wichtiges Element des Films. Die animierten Passagen fangen den absurden und frechsten Stil der Comics perfekt ein und bieten einige visuelle H√∂hepunkte. Die Integration von Zeichentrickfiguren in die reale Welt sorgt f√ºr eine unterhaltsame Dynamik und verst√§rkt den Eindruck, dass man in einem lebendigen Comicuniversum unterwegs ist.<br><br>‚ÄûWerner ‚Äì Das muss kesseln!!!‚Äú Ist sicherlich nicht f√ºr jeden Geschmack geeignet, insbesondere wenn man kein Gefallen an derben Komik und den √ºberzeichneten Charakteren findet. Dennoch bleibt der Film ein Klassiker des deutschen Humors und erfreut sich weiterhin gro√üer Beliebtheit bei Fans der Comics. F√ºr Liebhaber abgedrehter Kom√∂dien und Anh√§nger des Werner-Universums bietet der Film eine vergn√ºgliche Fahrt durch die skurrile Welt des beliebten Motorradfans und Chaosstifters.",0,0,2024-03-10T07:20:17Z,2025-02-11T14:04:06.828645

Hippies are not to blame as much as American idealists and left leaning liberals like Jane Fonda. These cowards and traitors defeated America during the Vietnam War.

3FJcYNQZioU,UggSH3rc8Q0cwngCoAEC,@ujfalusik1,"I saw this movie in Karlovy Vary international movie festival. It is a brilliant movie, the screenplay, camera and the actors, including the clever dog - make it unforgettable and brought me back to my memories from childhood in Czechoslovakia. I think that those who experienced dictatorship or totalitarian opression in their country will understand the director¬¥s feelings and intentions. For the others, let me explain, that the director Mr. Panahi made the full movie in his home prison, where he has to wait for the political trial. He is not allowed to shoot movies, nor to leave the house.¬†His daughter, who lives in Paris and was a guest in the festival said, that he might be put in jail and forbidden to shoot movies for next 20 years.¬† But his movie has not only strong autobiographic features, but is, above all, a brilliant metaphora of illiberal society and if there is still a freedom inside us, it is full of symbols too. It is thrilling from the beginning to the end...The director sometimes takes the role of the main actor and becomes his alter ego, or maybe it is vise versa, it is the main actor who is the alter ego of the director....All actors are brilliant, let me mention at least the young actress, who is a true epitom of young generation. And she is very hot too! The screenplay is so good and strong and the story is located in 1 place which makes it ideal for a theatrical play. But I am not sure, if there are so clever dogs, who could play the same role every night in a theatre. I wish the movie was released on DVD and became a theatre play too. Please write me, if you know where to get the movie.",7,1,2014-02-02T00:49:38Z,2025-02-11T14:04:10.309368
